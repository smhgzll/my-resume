Tech Influencer! Loves to spread dev-related info;
I deeply love Jetbrains products. At the same time, I am deeply connected to KISS, DRY and YAGNI principles.

Within Enerjisa (current employer), we develop high quality products, following the latest world-wide software development standards; unit test, sonarqube quality gates, ui test etc.

Tightly connected to Agile principles. For the last 2 years, I have been working with Trunk-based development and using Feature-toggling as needed.
